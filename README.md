## A. What the application does 

This application allows its users to perform the following: 

 1. Create/Edit/Delete/Details/View All Sellers
 2. Create/Edit/Delete/Details/View All Sales
 


## B. Architecture Solution 

The architectural design follows the 3-Layer architecture. A short description about the three layers follows: 

  ### 1. Data Access Layer
	  It is a class library project that implements this layer, which is responsible for storing and 
      retrieving data to a persistent database.  
  ### 2. Business Layer
      It is a class library project that implements this layer, which operates as the “middleman” 
     between the data access layer and the presentation layer. 
     It also contains all the business logic of the application (e.g. mappings, calculations etc.).
  ### 3. Presentation Layer  
      It is the front end layer in the 3-tier system and consists of the user interface. 


## C. Technologies/Frameworks used 

The solution is built using the following technologies/frameworks: 

C# .NET (Core) 5 Web Application MVC
